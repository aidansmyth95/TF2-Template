# TensorFlow 2 Template
I am lazy, and I hate redoing work that I have already done in the past. This repo is boilerplate TF2 code for training and evaluating a simple MNIST model.

## Contents
This repo contains:
- A requirements file to recreate quickly
- Data normalization
- Model creation
- Model training and evaluation
- Model visualization
- Model results visualization
- TensorBoard log setup and model checkpoints
